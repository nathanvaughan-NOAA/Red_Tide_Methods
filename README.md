# Methods for the Red Tide Project

This repository was made to store the scripts used for testing the implementation of red tide mortality in the Red Grouper stock assessment using SSMSE.

There are 3 main scripts for our SSMSE process. First is the SSMSE_red_grouper_start.R file which defines the scenarios and initiates the SSMSE runs. The diagnostic_ssmse.R file extracts data directly from the stock synthesis runs and summarizes more complex statistics like catch at age and selectivity. Finally, the future_red_tide_results_review or red_tide_2_years_results_review generate all of the results figures and tables for reviewing the summarized outputs. The current project uses the red_tide_2_years_results_review.

Previous runs houses all of the html files of previous runs we chose to highlight throughout the process. For example, the 2025_07_03 runs titled SigmaR, r0_SigmaR, and 2025_07_07_r0 were tests with either SigmaR, R0, or both fixed.
